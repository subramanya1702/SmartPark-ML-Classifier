# Smart-Park-Reboot

## Overview

This work is based on [Sriranga Chaitanya Nandam's Master's Project](https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/si-lab/#archive):
* [PDF](https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/si-lab/archive/2022_chaitanya.pdf)
* [Github](https://github.com/NSR9/Smart-Park)

Ingress and egress pipelines developed by Chaitanya, have undergone modifications to enhance their performance and scalability. 
The ingress pipeline has been refactored to insert data into a MongoDb database and is now executed as a Docker container.
Likewise, the egress pipeline, which was previously hosted on AWS using technologies like Lambda and API Gateway, has been migrated to a simpler NodeJs server, tasked with fetching data from MongoDb.
Both pipelines, along with the MongoDb, are now bundled and executed as Docker containers.

Below is a reworked architecture diagram.

## Architecture Diagram

The following sections guide you through the process of executing the **ingress pipeline** as a docker container.
An already built image can be found [here](https://oregonstate.app.box.com/folder/209117371306)

Note: For more information about egress pipeline including MongoDb, check out this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/subramanya1702/Smart-Park-Server)

## Usage
The usage instructions have been split into two parts, depending on whether the Egress pipeline's Docker image is pre-built or not.

### Docker image is pre-built

1. Continue with this section if the docker image is available over [here](https://oregonstate.app.box.com/folder/209117371306). 
If not, jump ahead to the [next](#docker-image-is-not-pre-built) section.
2. Ensure you are on a system operating on an x86 architecture with Linux as its operating system.
3. A minimum of 2GB of RAM and 24GB of disk space should be allocated 
4. Make sure docker is installed. If not, install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
5. Download the latest Smart Park tar archive file from the box folder over [here](https://oregonstate.app.box.com/folder/209117371306) 
6. Unzip the tar archive
    ```sh
    tar -xzvf <filename>.tar.gz
    ```

7. Now, build a docker image from the tar archive
   ```sh
   docker load --input <filename>.tar
   ```
   
8. Confirm whether the image has been created successfully by executing the following command
    ```sh
    docker images
    ```
   
9. Run a docker container using the newly generated image. The command will launch a new container in detached mode.
    ```sh
    docker run -d --env DB_CONN_STR=HOSTNAME --name spclassifier --restart always <image_name>
    ```
    DB_CONN_STR is the mongodb connection string that needs to be passed as an environment variable to the container.
    Example:
    
    * Using database server's DNS: `DB_CONN_STR=db.domain.com:{port}`
    * Using database server's public/external IP: `DB_CONN_STR=x.x.x.x:{port}`
    * Testing locally: `DB_CONN_STR=localhost:{port}` or `DB_CONN_STR=127.0.0.1:{port}`

10. Inspect the container logs and verify if the pipeline is running without any errors
    ```sh
    docker logs -f --tail 500 spclassifier
    ```

11. Log in to the MongoDb container and verify if records are getting inserted into `recentParkingLots` and `parkingLotHistory` collections.

### Docker image is not pre-built

1. Ensure that you are on a Linux system with x86 architecture. If you donâ€™t have access to one, follow the below instructions.
   Note: These instructions assume that you will be using AWS as the cloud service provider. Skip this step if you are using a different provider.
   1. Go to EC2 console in AWS
   2. Create a new instance with the following configuration
      1. Name: SmartPark
      2. AMI: Ubuntu 22.04
      3. Architecture: 64-bit x86
      4. Type: t2.small
      5. Create a new key pair or select an existing one
      6. In network settings, select the default VPC (Create a new one if you want)
      7. Enable Auto assign public IP
      8. Create a new security group and allow SSH traffic from your IP
      9. In Storage settings, allocate a minimum of 24GiB of gp2 storage
      10. Launch the instance
      11. Connect to the instance through SSH

2. Install docker by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
3. Clone the SmartPark repository from [here](https://github.com/subramanya1702/Smart-Park-Reboot)
4. Download the pytorch file: X-512.pt from [here](https://oregonstate.app.box.com/file/1221361939384)
5. Now that everything is set up, we can go ahead and build a docker image
    ```sh
    sudo docker build -t spclassifier .
    ```
   
6. Copy the image to wherever necessary/convenient.
7. Run a docker container using the newly copied image. The command will launch a new container in detached mode.
    ```sh
    sudo docker run -d --env DB_CONN_STR=HOSTNAME --name spclassifier --restart always spclassifier
    ```
    DB_CONN_STR is the mongodb connection string that needs to be passed as an environment variable to the container.
    Example:
    
    * Using database server's DNS: `DB_CONN_STR=db.domain.com:{port}`
    * Using database server's public/external IP: `DB_CONN_STR=x.x.x.x:{port}`
    * Testing locally: `DB_CONN_STR=localhost:{port}` or `DB_CONN_STR=127.0.0.1:{port}`

8. Log in to the MongoDb container and verify if records are getting inserted into `recentParkingLots` and `parkingLotHistory` collections.
9. Don't forget to deallocate any resources that were provisioned on AWS.
